# share-code
a repo that i'll be using to share code snippets with my friends. \
why don't i just use Gist?\
i don't want to crowd my Gist page is all

<br/>

there isn't really anything much for you to use out here. everything would be out of context\
but knock yourself out. 

[licensed under wtfpl](./LICENSE) \
excuse the language, i guess? \
but that's the license i think works best for this repo, which is a bunch of stuff put together with no context whatsover. lemme know if you have comments on my horrible coding procedures tho! :tada:
